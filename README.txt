HOW TO RUN:
	1. On the files data1.txt, data2.txt, and data3.txt, remove the header text (Where is says "Spell_name, type", etc.
	2. In putty type "g++ *.cpp" then run "./a.out"
	3. Once the program starts you will want to load in the data files by the instructions in the code (press 1 to enter the file details for "data1.txt", 2 for "data2.txt" and 3 for "data3.txt"
	4. The menu should then gice you multiple options to choose form in order to run the program, such as finding the highest level of spell in a class, etc

NOTES:
	While I know execuses arent accepted I felt the need to explain why my work may not be up to par. I have been dealing with family health issues outside of shcool that have taken me away from my coursework 
	(My mother has been in and out of hospitals and is currently in florida to try and get on a transplant list, leaving me to take care of my brother and my house). 
	Again, I know that is no excuse, but I just know I could do better.
	Because of these family issues I will most likely need to retake the course, so I will use this as a resource and reference to do better nect time. Thank you.
